# ml_assignment_2

Model consisting in the combination of a neural network, a support vector classifier and a adaboosted random forest.

## Testing

### A. Our models testing
To test our models, models and predictions are in the non _test folders and files. The files contained in these folders shouldn't be changed. They were used for the final prediction.

### B. Test by creating your own models and predictions
To generate code please save models and csv files in folders or csv files ending by _test.

### C. Test Order
Launch files in these order without forgeting to uncomment some execution lines in files:
- feature_creation_and_preprocessing.py
- feature_selection.py
- train models and predict: neural_network.py, support_vector_classifier.py and adaboost_random_forest.py
- vote_from_csvs.py
